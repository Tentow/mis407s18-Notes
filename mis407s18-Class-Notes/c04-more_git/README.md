# c04 - Git and GitHub

In this class we continue our discussion of the basics of local repository management.

Last class, we saw these workflows:

1. Create git repository (`git init`)
1. Stage files (`git add`)
1. Commit files (`git commit`)
1. Check status (`git status`)
1. Review commit log (`git log`)

Today we will add these key workflows/tasks:

1. Rolling back changes.
1. Managing experimental/test changes to your released code.

By end of class you should know how to:

1. Initialize a repo, add files to staging area, and commit files to your repository.
2. Reset your repository to a previous commit point (only use this as a last resort -- proper branch management should help you avoid needing to do this)
3. List all branches, create a branch, know which branch you are one, and switch between branches.
