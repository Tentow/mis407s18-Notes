# Your MIS407 Private Repo

You will submit individual assignments using Git. As mentioned previously, each MIS407 student will have access to a private GitHub repo. I've created one for each of you. You should now see this repo as mis407s18-student-xx.

Let's add to this repo (you should already have cloned it based on the instructions in [1.cloning_class_repo.md](1.cloning_class_repo.md))

## Add files to your local repo

Add a file HelloWorld.txt to your local repo's root directory.

```
echo "Hello world!" >> HelloWorld.txt
```

Now "push" this content up to your GitHub server

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add HelloWorld.txt"
git push origin master
```

To verify, go to your GitHub repo web-page and confirm that the HelloWorld.txt file is now loaded.
