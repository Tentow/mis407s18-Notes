# c05 - Markdown (MD) and quick intro to Atom

In this class we'll finish looking at git branching and merging, then we'll look at the Markdown document markup language. We will also quickly re-introduce Atom.

Last class, we saw these key workflows/tasks:

1. Clone repo from Github.
1. Rolling back changes.
1. Managing experimental/test changes to your released code.

By end of class you should know how to:

1. Branch and merge git branches.
1. Write simple Markdown documents.
1. Use Atom to open and write text files.
